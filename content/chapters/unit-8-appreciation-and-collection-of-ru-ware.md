## Part 2: Ru Ware Background

### Reading: The Art of Connoisseurship

**Paragraph 1: What is Connoisseurship?**

Connoisseurship is the ability to recognize, appreciate, and evaluate fine art and crafts through deep knowledge, trained perception, and refined aesthetic sensitivity. A connoisseur (行家/鉴赏家) can distinguish authentic works from imitations, recognize the hand of specific masters, date pieces accurately, and assess artistic quality and historical significance. In the realm of Ru Ware, connoisseurship represents centuries of accumulated wisdom about this rarest of Chinese ceramics. True connoisseurs develop their expertise through years of study, careful observation of authentic pieces, understanding of historical contexts, and cultivation of aesthetic discernment. This expertise cannot be learned from books alone—it requires direct experience examining real objects, ideally under the guidance of established experts.

**Paragraph 2: The Rarity and Value of Authentic Ru Ware**

Authentic Song Dynasty Ru Ware ranks among the world's most valuable ceramics. Several factors contribute to extraordinary valuations:

**Extreme Rarity**: Only 60-70 complete pieces of genuine Song Dynasty Ru Ware are confirmed to exist worldwide. Compare this to thousands of surviving pieces from other Song kilns like Ding or Longquan celadon. This scarcity results from Ru Ware's brief production period—approximately 20 years during Emperor Huizong's reign (1100-1120 AD)—and the kiln's exclusive imperial patronage. When the Song Dynasty fell in 1127, Ru kilns ceased operation, and the secrets of production were lost.

**Imperial Provenance**: Ru Ware was made exclusively for imperial use. Each piece served the emperor and his court, connecting collectors today to one of China's most culturally sophisticated periods. This direct link to imperial power and refined taste adds immeasurable historical and cultural value.

**Aesthetic Perfection**: Connoisseurs consider Ru Ware the pinnacle of ceramic achievement—perfect proportions, sublime glaze quality, and restrained elegance that has never been surpassed. The legendary sky-blue glaze, jade-like texture, and subtle crackle patterns represent an aesthetic ideal.

**Cultural Significance**: Ru Ware embodies Song Dynasty philosophy emphasizing simplicity, natural beauty, and intellectual refinement. It represents not just ceramic technology but an entire worldview and cultural moment.

**Market Performance**: Recent auction results demonstrate extraordinary value. In 2017, a Ru Ware dish sold for HK$294 million (US$37.7 million) at Sotheby's Hong Kong, setting a world record for any Chinese ceramic. Even small fragments of authentic Ru Ware command substantial prices. A 2012 Sotheby's sale of Ru Ware fragments (largest piece only 7cm) achieved £561,250 (approximately $900,000).

**Paragraph 3: Authentication Challenges**

Determining authenticity presents formidable challenges. Multiple factors complicate authentication:

**Historical Production**: Modern craftsmen have attempted to recreate Ru Ware for over 800 years. Some reproductions from Ming and Qing dynasties are themselves now antiques and quite valuable. Distinguishing Song originals from later copies requires sophisticated knowledge.

**Scientific Limitations**: While scientific analysis (thermoluminescence testing, glaze composition analysis, microscopy) can help, no single test definitively proves authenticity. Skilled forgers understand these tests and can sometimes fool them. Science informs connoisseurship but cannot replace it.

**Condition Issues**: Many authentic pieces show damage or repair from centuries of use. Cracks, chips, and restored areas complicate assessment. Sometimes damage exposes the clay body, providing authentication clues, but it also reduces value.

**Provenance Gaps**: Many Ru Ware pieces changed hands numerous times over centuries, often without documentation. Provenance (ownership history) helps authentication, but gaps are common and don't necessarily indicate forgery.

**Market Incentives**: With individual pieces worth millions, incentives for forgery are enormous. Sophisticated fake pieces regularly appear, sometimes fooling even experienced collectors initially.

**Paragraph 4: Authentication Methods**

Experts use multiple approaches to assess authenticity:

**Visual Examination**: Connoisseurs examine:

- **Glaze Quality**: Authentic Ru glaze has specific characteristics—soft luster, jade-like texture, precise color tone, natural crackle patterns. Reproductions often show too-bright glaze, incorrect color, or artificial-looking crackles.
- **Clay Body**: Where exposed (foot ring, chips), the clay should show correct color, texture, and firing characteristics. Song Dynasty Ru clay typically shows fine, dense structure and specific coloration.
- **Proportions and Form**: Authentic pieces exhibit proportions reflecting Song aesthetic principles. Subtle details—rim thickness, foot ring design, overall balance—follow specific patterns. Modern copies often show slight inaccuracies.
- **Patina and Age**: Genuine pieces show natural aging—glaze weathering, subtle wear patterns, and accumulated patina from centuries of handling. These characteristics are difficult to fake convincingly.
- **Crackle Patterns**: Authentic crackle develops naturally during firing and continues evolving over centuries as substances seep into cracks. Natural crackles show specific characteristics different from artificial crackling.

**Technical Analysis**:

- **Thermoluminescence (TL) Testing**: Measures accumulated radiation in clay, indicating approximate age. However, sophisticated forgers can manipulate results.
- **X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)**: Analyzes glaze composition non-destructively. Helps identify whether materials match Song Dynasty formulations.
- **Microscopy**: High-magnification examination reveals details invisible to naked eyes—glaze structure, crystal formation, wear patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing suspected piece with confirmed authentic examples under controlled conditions.

**Provenance Research**:

- Tracing ownership history through documents, catalogs, photographs
- Identifying exhibition history and scholarly publications
- Checking against known collections and recorded pieces
- Investigating seller's acquisition history

**Expert Consensus**: Major authentication decisions typically involve multiple experts examining pieces and reaching consensus. Single expert opinions, while valuable, are considered less reliable than collective judgment.

**Paragraph 5: Understanding Aesthetic Quality**

Beyond authentication, connoisseurs assess aesthetic quality and artistic merit:

**Glaze Quality**: Not all authentic Ru Ware is equally beautiful. Experts evaluate:

- **Color**: Does the sky-blue approach the ideal? Is it uniform or patchy? Too pale or too dark?
- **Texture**: Is the jade-like quality fully developed? Does it show proper translucency and warmth?
- **Luster**: Is the soft, subtle sheen perfect, or is the glaze too glossy or too matte?
- **Crackle**: Are patterns aesthetically pleasing? Too sparse, too dense, or beautifully balanced?

**Form and Proportions**: Aesthetic evaluation considers:

- Harmony of proportions
- Elegance of curves and lines
- Balance and symmetry
- Relationship between parts (rim, body, foot)
- Overall presence and visual impact

**Condition**: Damage significantly affects both value and appreciation:

- Pristine pieces command premium prices
- Minor damage (small chips, hairline cracks) reduces value moderately
- Major damage (large cracks, significant repair) substantially reduces value
- However, historical importance can outweigh condition issues

**Rarity within Rarity**: Some forms are rarer than others. Certain shapes (like narcissus planters or tripod incense burners) are especially scarce, commanding higher prices than more common forms like small dishes.

**Historical Significance**: Pieces with exceptional provenance—owned by famous collectors, illustrated in important publications, or exhibited in major museums—achieve premium valuations.

**Paragraph 6: The Collecting World**

Serious Ru Ware collecting occupies a rarefied realm accessible to few:

**Major Collectors**: Given extreme rarity and value, most authentic Ru Ware resides in:

- **Museums**: The National Palace Museum in Taipei holds the largest collection (21 pieces). Other major holdings include Beijing's Palace Museum, Shanghai Museum, British Museum, and Percival David Foundation (now part of British Museum collection). Museums rarely deaccession (sell) Ru Ware.
- **Private Collectors**: A small number of extremely wealthy collectors own authentic pieces. Many prefer anonymity, and their collections remain largely unknown to the public. Private ownership sometimes means pieces disappear from scholarly view for generations.
- **Royal and Imperial Collections**: Some pieces remain in historical collections (former imperial collection divided between Taiwan and mainland China).

**Building a Collection**: For collectors unable to acquire authentic Song Dynasty pieces, alternatives include:

- **Later Dynasty Copies**: Ming and Qing dynasty Ru-style pieces offer more accessibility while maintaining historical significance.
- **Modern Master Works**: Contemporary Ru Ware by recognized masters provides high quality at achievable prices ($1,000-$50,000 depending on artist and piece).
- **Fragments**: Even fragments of authentic Ru Ware connect collectors to history, at relatively lower cost.
- **Related Ceramics**: Other Song Dynasty ceramics (Guan, Ge, Jun, Ding) offer comparable aesthetic pleasure and historical interest with greater availability.

**Collector Motivations**: Different collectors pursue different goals:

- **Investment**: Some view ceramic collecting as financial investment, tracking market values and trends.
- **Aesthetic Pleasure**: Many collect primarily for beauty, displaying pieces and living with them daily.
- **Scholarly Interest**: Academic collectors study pieces, publish research, and contribute to knowledge.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Some see collecting as protecting cultural heritage and ensuring proper care.
- **Status and Prestige**: Owning significant pieces confers social standing in certain circles.

**Paragraph 7: The Auction Market**

Major auction houses (Sotheby's, Christie's, Poly Auction, China Guardian) regularly feature Ru Ware and related ceramics:

**Auction Process**:

1. **Consignment**: Owner consigns piece to auction house
2. **Authentication**: Auction house experts examine and authenticate (to extent possible)
3. **Cataloging**: Detailed description written, professional photography, condition report
4. **Marketing**: Pre-auction exhibitions, catalog distribution, media coverage
5. **Auction Event**: Public or private bidding
6. **Sale**: Hammer falls, buyer pays premium (typically 25% additional to hammer price)
7. **Transfer**: After payment clearance, piece transfers to new owner

**Buyer's Premium**: Winning bidders pay auction house commission (buyer's premium) on top of hammer price, typically 25-30% depending on final price tier.

**Guarantees and Authenticity**: Major auction houses guarantee authenticity for limited period (typically 5 years). If later proven fake, they refund purchase price. This guarantee provides some buyer protection but isn't absolute—disputes occasionally arise.

**Pre-Sale Estimates**: Auction houses publish estimated price ranges. These estimates influence bidding but are not binding. Exceptional pieces often significantly exceed estimates.

**Reserve Prices**: Sellers typically set confidential minimum prices (reserves). If bidding doesn't reach reserve, piece doesn't sell.

**Bidding Strategies**: Experienced collectors employ various strategies—aggressive early bidding to discourage competition, waiting until final moments to bid, setting maximum limits and walking away, using agents to bid anonymously.

**Paragraph 8: Museum Curation and Exhibition**

Museums play crucial roles in preserving, studying, and displaying Ru Ware:

**Curatorial Responsibilities**:

- **Conservation**: Maintaining proper environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, light) to prevent deterioration
- **Documentation**: Maintaining detailed records of provenance, condition, exhibitions, publications
- **Research**: Conducting and supporting scholarly research
- **Exhibition**: Making collections accessible to public while protecting objects
- **Education**: Providing context and interpretation for general audiences

**Exhibition Considerations**: Displaying Ru Ware presents unique challenges:

- **Security**: Given value, pieces require high security—reinforced cases, alarms, guards, insurance
- **Lighting**: Must showcase glaze qualities without causing damage (UV filtering, low light levels)
- **Case Design**: Display height and angle affect viewing experience; cases must be dust-free and climate-controlled
- **Interpretation**: Labels and multimedia must educate without overshadowing objects themselves
- **Context**: Showing related pieces, historical information, and cultural context enhances appreciation

**Loans and Traveling Exhibitions**: Museums occasionally loan pieces for special exhibitions. Insurance requirements and condition concerns make loans complex and expensive. Some institutions refuse to loan most vulnerable objects.

**Digital Access**: Museums increasingly provide online access—high-resolution photographs, 3D models, virtual tours, scholarly databases. This democratizes access while protecting physical objects.

### Reading Practice

**Task 1: Auction Catalog Entry Analysis**

Read this auction catalog description:

```
LOT 247
A RARE RU WARE SKY-BLUE GLAZED BRUSH WASHER
SONG DYNASTY (960-1279)

The shallow circular vessel with gently rounded sides rising from a short straight foot, covered overall save for the foot ring with a lustrous sky-blue glaze suffused with a delicate network of golden crackles, the glaze continuing over the rim to the interior, the exposed biscuit on the unglazed foot showing an orange-brown body.

Diameter: 13.2 cm (5 1/4 in.)

PROVENANCE:
Collection of C.T. Loo, Paris, prior to 1950
Collection of John Sparks Ltd., London, 1950-1975
Private European collection, acquired from the above in 1975
Sotheby's London, November 12, 1998, lot 85
Private Asian collection, acquired from the above

LITERATURE:
R.L. Hobson, "Sung Dynasty Ceramics," Oriental Ceramic Society Transactions, Vol. 15, 1937-38, pl. 34b
Exhibition of Sung Dynasty Ru Ware, National Palace Museum, Taipei, 1989, cat. no. 17

EXHIBITED:
"Imperial Taste: Chinese Ceramics from the Percival David Foundation," British Museum, London, 1989

ESTIMATE: HK$15,000,000 - 25,000,000
            (US$1,900,000 - 3,200,000)

The elegant form and sublime glaze quality of this exceptionally rare brush washer exemplify the aesthetic refinement of Ru ware. The lustrous sky-blue tone, approaching the ideal described as "the color of the sky after rain when clouds break," demonstrates the mastery achieved by imperial kilns. The naturally formed crackle patterns, enhanced by centuries of use, add visual interest while testifying to the piece's antiquity.

Ru ware production was limited to approximately twenty years during the Northern Song Dynasty, exclusively for imperial use. The extreme rarity of genuine Ru ware—with fewer than seventy complete pieces known worldwide—makes this brush washer particularly significant. The present example's well-documented provenance, scholarly publication, and museum exhibition history further enhance its importance and value.

Comparable examples include a similar brush washer in the National Palace Museum, Taipei (illustrated in Regina Krahl, "Chinese Ceramics from the Meiyintang Collection," Vol. 1, 1994, no. 524), and another in the Palace Museum, Beijing.

## Part 6: Cultural Insight

### The Philosophy of Collecting

**Why Do People Collect?**

Collecting is a deeply human behavior crossing all cultures. Psychological and cultural motivations include:

**Possession and Control**: Owning rare objects provides a sense of mastery and accomplishment. In a chaotic world, a collection represents order and completion.

**Connection to History**: Authentic Ru Ware physically connects collectors to Song Dynasty—touching a bowl that an emperor might have used creates tangible historical link across centuries.

**Aesthetic Pleasure**: Living with beautiful objects enriches daily life. Collectors describe aesthetic nourishment from contemplating pieces in their collection.

**Social Status**: Historically, collecting demonstrated wealth, education, and refined taste. Elite collecting established cultural authority and social position.

**Investment**: For some, collecting represents financial strategy. Art and antiques can appreciate significantly, though this shouldn't be sole motivation.

**Intellectual Engagement**: Serious collecting involves continuous learning—studying history, developing connoisseurship, engaging with scholars and dealers.

**Preservation Responsibility**: Collectors often see themselves as temporary custodians of cultural heritage, responsible for proper care and eventual transmission.

**The Ethics of Collecting**

Cultural property collecting raises complex ethical questions:

**Provenance and Looting**: Is ownership legitimate if provenance is unclear? Should collectors investigate whether pieces were looted from archaeological sites or stolen from museums? Many countries have strict laws against exporting cultural property.

**Repatriation Debates**: Should cultural treasures remain in their countries of origin, or can international collecting promote cross-cultural appreciation? The debate over repatriating museum collections remains contentious.

**Access vs. Private Ownership**: When collectors keep pieces private, scholars and public lose access. Museums make collections accessible but can't afford to compete with wealthy private collectors at auction.

**Market Effects**: Does high-value collecting encourage forgery and looting? Or does it support preservation by making proper conservation economically viable?

**Cultural Context**: Can appreciation be authentic when objects are removed from original cultural context? Or does international collecting create new appreciative contexts?

**Chinese Collecting Traditions**

Chinese collecting culture has distinctive characteristics:

**Scholar-Collectors**: Traditionally, Chinese collectors were often scholars who valued objects for aesthetic and intellectual qualities, not just rarity or cost. The ideal collector possessed profound knowledge, refined taste, and moral cultivation.

**The Concept of "Yangqi" (养器)**: Literally "nourishing objects," this practice involves regularly handling and contemplating pieces, believing that human interaction enhances their spiritual qualities. For Ru Ware, this means pieces gain patina and character through careful use and handling over generations.

**Transmission and Legacy**: Chinese collectors traditionally viewed themselves as links in a chain—receiving treasures from previous generations and transmitting them to future ones. Personal ownership was temporary; cultural stewardship was eternal.

**Seals and Inscriptions**: Chinese collectors often added seal marks or inscriptions to pieces, creating layers of historical documentation. Each collector's mark becomes part of the object's story.

**Study and Scholarship**: Serious Chinese collectors produced scholarly catalogs, essays, and research contributing to cultural knowledge. Collecting and scholarship were inseparable.

**Tea Culture Connection**: Many Ru Ware pieces were designed for tea culture. The relationship between collector, tea practice, and ceramic vessels created holistic aesthetic experience—not just owning objects but living with them meaningfully.

**Modern Tensions**: Contemporary Chinese collecting faces new dynamics:

- Rapid wealth creation produces new collectors without traditional education
- International competition drives prices to unprecedented levels
- Government restrictions on cultural property export create complex situations
- Repatriation desires clash with global market realities
- Traditional scholar-collector ideal competes with investment-driven collecting

**Western Collecting Approaches**

Western collecting traditions differ in several ways:

**Museum-Centered**: European and American collecting developed alongside museums. Many major collections eventually entered museums through donation, creating public-benefit tradition.

**Scientific Cataloging**: Western scholarship emphasized systematic classification, scientific analysis, and comprehensive documentation.

**Market-Driven**: Auction houses and dealers created sophisticated international market infrastructure. Collecting became increasingly commodified and financially oriented.

**Aesthetic Universalism**: Western collectors embraced "masterpieces" from all cultures, arguing that great art transcends cultural boundaries and benefits humanity when accessible to all.

**Legal Framework**: Western countries developed complex laws around cultural property, though implementation and philosophy vary significantly by nation.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What motivates you to collect or own beautiful objects?
2. Should important cultural treasures be privately owned or belong in museums?
3. How does your cultural background affect your appreciation of Ru Ware?
4. Can someone from outside Chinese culture truly appreciate Ru Ware, or does it require cultural insider knowledge?
5. If you could own one authentic Ru Ware piece, would you? What would you do with it?
6. What responsibilities come with owning culturally significant objects?
