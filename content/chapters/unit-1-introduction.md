## Part 2: Ru Ware Background

### Reading: The Treasure of Ruzhou

**Paragraph 1: What is Ru Ware?**

Ru Ware is one of China's most valuable ceramic treasures. It was made in Ruzhou (today's Ruzhou City, Henan Province) during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127 AD). Ru Ware is famous for its beautiful sky-blue glaze and simple, elegant shapes. Today, only about 60-70 authentic Ru Ware pieces exist in the world, making it extremely rare and precious.

**Paragraph 2: The Five Great Kilns**

During the Song Dynasty, China had five famous porcelain kilns: Ru, Guan, Ge, Jun, and Ding. Among these five kilns, Ru ranked first. The saying goes: "Ru is the best, Guan comes second." Ru Ware was made specifically for the imperial court. Only the emperor and royal family could use it. This made Ru Ware a symbol of power and taste.

**Paragraph 3: Why is Ru Ware Special?**

Ru Ware has three main features that make it unique:

1. **Sky-blue glaze**: The glaze color looks like the sky after rain. Chinese people describe it as "the sky blue that appears when clouds break after rain" (雨过天晴云破处). This beautiful color comes from a special formula that includes agate.

2. **Crackle patterns**: The surface has tiny cracks called "crackle glaze" or "ice crackle." These cracks form naturally during the cooling process. They look like broken ice and add to the beauty of the piece.

3. **Simple elegance**: Ru Ware has no colorful decorations or patterns. Its beauty comes from its pure color, smooth texture, and perfect shape. This matches the Song Dynasty aesthetic philosophy: "beauty in simplicity."
