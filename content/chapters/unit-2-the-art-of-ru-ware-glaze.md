## Part 2: Ru Ware Background

### Reading: The Mystery of Sky-Blue Glaze

**Paragraph 1: The Legendary Color**

The glaze of Ru Ware is its most famous feature. The color is often described as "sky-blue" or "azure blue." However, this is not an ordinary blue. It is a soft, gentle blue with a hint of green and gray. Chinese people call it "tianqing" (天青), which means "the color of the sky after rain clears." This poetic description captures the unique beauty of Ru glaze. The color looks different under different lighting conditions - sometimes more blue, sometimes more green, like the changing sky.

**Paragraph 2: The Secret Ingredient - Agate**

What makes Ru Ware glaze so special? The answer lies in a precious stone: agate (玛瑙). Ancient craftsmen ground agate into powder and mixed it into the glaze formula. Agate contains minerals that create the soft, jade-like quality of Ru glaze. This was an expensive technique. Using agate made Ru Ware very costly to produce. That is one reason why so few pieces were made. Historical records say: "Agate is used as glaze, so its color is extraordinary."

**Paragraph 3: The Magic of Crackle Glaze**

Another remarkable feature of Ru Ware is its crackle patterns (开片). These are tiny cracks that appear on the glaze surface. The cracks form during the cooling process after firing. When the porcelain cools, the glaze and the clay body contract at different rates. This creates beautiful, natural crack patterns. The Chinese call these patterns "ice crackle" (冰裂纹) because they look like cracked ice. In other ceramics, cracks might be considered defects. But in Ru Ware, they are treasured as part of its beauty.

**Paragraph 4: The Beauty of Imperfection**

The crackle patterns show an important Chinese aesthetic concept: the beauty of natural imperfection. Song Dynasty artists believed that perfect smoothness was less interesting than natural variations. Each piece of Ru Ware has unique crackle patterns - no two pieces are exactly the same. Over time, tea stains and other substances seep into these tiny cracks, creating darker lines. Collectors call this process "developing crackles" (养纹). The patterns become more beautiful with age.

**Paragraph 5: Other Glaze Characteristics**

Besides color and crackle, Ru glaze has other special qualities:

1. **Luster**: The surface has a soft, gentle shine. It is not too bright or glossy. The Chinese describe it as "jade-like luster" (玉质感).

2. **Translucency**: When you hold Ru Ware up to the light, the glaze appears slightly translucent, like jade. This quality is called "warm and moist" (温润).

3. **Thickness**: The glaze layer is thick and rich. It covers the entire surface evenly, creating a smooth, perfect finish.

4. **Opalescence**: Under certain light, the glaze shows a subtle rainbow effect, like opal gemstones. This comes from the complex minerals in the glaze.

## Part 6: Cultural Insight

### The Philosophy of Tianqing (天青)

**The Color of Heaven**

In Chinese culture, "tianqing" (天青) is more than just a color - it represents a spiritual ideal. The phrase "雨过天晴云破处" (the sky blue that appears when clouds break after rain) was supposedly spoken by Emperor Huizong. This moment - when the storm has passed and the sky clears - symbolizes:

- **Clarity after confusion**: Like wisdom after learning
- **Peace after turmoil**: Like calmness after challenge
- **Hope and renewal**: Like a fresh beginning
- **Natural perfection**: The most beautiful moment in nature

**The Jade Connection**

Chinese people often compare Ru glaze to jade (玉). Why is jade so important in Chinese culture?

- Jade represents moral virtue and purity
- It symbolizes gentleness and warmth
- It connects humans with nature
- It shows inner beauty, not flashy appearance

When people say Ru glaze is "jade-like," they mean it has these same qualities:

- Soft, not harsh
- Natural, not artificial
- Inner beauty, not surface decoration
- Warmth, not coldness

**The Beauty of Wabi-Sabi**

The appreciation of crackle patterns connects to the philosophy of finding beauty in imperfection. This concept exists in both Chinese and Japanese aesthetics:

- **Natural aging**: Cracks show the passage of time
- **Uniqueness**: No two pieces are the same
- **Acceptance**: Embracing natural changes
- **Authenticity**: Real, not artificially perfect

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How is the Chinese aesthetic philosophy different from Western ideas of perfection?
2. What other examples of "beauty in imperfection" can you think of?
3. Do you prefer perfect smoothness or natural crackle patterns? Why?
4. How does the color "sky-blue" make you feel?

---

## Part 7: Grammar Workshop

### Comparative and Superlative Practice

**Exercise 1: Complete the Sentences**

Use the correct form of the adjective:

1. Ru glaze is **____** (soft) than Jun glaze.
2. Sky-blue is the **____** (beautiful) color among all celadon glazes.
3. Agate makes the glaze **____** (expensive) to produce.
4. Ru Ware has the **____** (fine) crackle patterns.
5. The glaze appears **____** (translucent) under bright light.
6. This piece is **____** (rare) than that one.
7. Ancient techniques were **____** (complex) than modern methods.
8. Ru Ware is the **____** (valuable) ceramic in the world.

**Exercise 2: Rewrite Using Comparatives**

Example: Ru glaze is smooth. Jun glaze is not as smooth.
→ Ru glaze is smoother than Jun glaze.

1. Ru glaze is thick. Other glazes are thinner.
2. The sky-blue color is subtle. Bright blue is not subtle.
3. Crackle patterns are beautiful. Plain surfaces are less beautiful.
4. Agate is expensive. Regular minerals are cheap.

**Exercise 3: Make Superlative Sentences**

Use these prompts to write superlative sentences:

1. Ru Ware / rare / Song ceramics
2. Sky-blue / famous / Ru glaze colors
3. Crackle patterns / distinctive / feature
4. Agate formula / important / ingredient

## Teacher's Notes

**Teaching Tips:**

1. **Visual Support**: Show many high-quality photos of Ru glaze under different lighting. If possible, bring replica pieces for students to touch.

2. **Hands-on Activity**: If accessible, visit a ceramic studio so students can see and feel different glazes. Understanding texture through touch helps with description.

3. **Color Vocabulary**: Practice color descriptions with various objects, not just porcelain. This builds general descriptive skills.

4. **Grammar Practice**: Create more comparison exercises using familiar objects (phones, books, clothing) before moving to porcelain.

5. **AI Integration**: Demonstrate AI tools in class before asking students to use them independently. Show both successes and limitations.

**Common Student Errors:**

- Confusing "smooth" (texture) with "soft" (color quality)
- Overusing "very" instead of more precise adjectives
- Literal translations from Chinese (e.g., "open piece" for 开片)
- Incorrect comparative forms (e.g., "more soft" instead of "softer")

**Extension Activities:**

- Science connection: Explain the chemistry of glaze formation
- Math connection: Calculate glaze recipes by percentage
- Art connection: Paint watercolors to understand color mixing
- History connection: Research Song Dynasty material culture

**Assessment Options:**

- **Informal**: Participation in speaking activities, AI tool usage
- **Formal**: Written comparison essay, vocabulary quiz, oral presentation
- **Portfolio**: Collect students' project work, reflections, AI-generated content

**Differentiation:**

- **Advanced students**: Research glaze chemistry, explain scientific principles
- **Struggling students**: Provide word banks, sentence frames, more examples
- **Visual learners**: Focus on image analysis and AI-generated visuals
- **Kinesthetic learners**: Arrange hands-on activities with actual ceramics
