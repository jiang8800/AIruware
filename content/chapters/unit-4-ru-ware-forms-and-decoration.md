## Part 2: Ru Ware Background

### Reading: The Elegant Forms of Ru Ware

**Paragraph 1: The Beauty of Simplicity**

Ru Ware is famous for its simple, elegant forms. Unlike other porcelain types with complex decorations, Ru Ware relies on pure shape and perfect proportions for its beauty. The Song Dynasty aesthetic valued restraint and subtlety over elaborate ornamentation. Emperor Huizong, a renowned artist himself, preferred ceramics with clean lines and graceful curves. This philosophy is captured in the Chinese saying: "Form follows function, beauty lies in simplicity" (器以载道，大道至简). Each Ru Ware vessel was designed not just to be beautiful, but to serve a specific purpose in daily life or ceremonial use.

**Paragraph 2: Common Ru Ware Vessel Types**

Although only about 60-70 authentic Ru Ware pieces survive today, we can identify several main types:

1. **Plates and Dishes (盘/碟)**: Flat or shallow vessels with wide mouths, used for serving food or displaying objects. Sizes range from small (10-15 cm diameter) to large (20-30 cm diameter).

2. **Bowls (碗)**: Round vessels with curved walls, deeper than plates. Used for eating rice, soup, or tea. Most Ru bowls are small to medium-sized, fitting comfortably in the hand.

3. **Washers (洗)**: Shallow, wide vessels used for washing brushes in calligraphy or for holding water. These often have gently curved sides and flat bottoms.

4. **Vases (瓶)**: Tall vessels with narrow necks, used for holding flowers or as decorative objects. Ru vases typically have simple, elegant profiles without complex decorations.

5. **Tripod Vessels (三足器)**: Vessels supported by three legs, often inspired by ancient bronze forms. These include incense burners and washers.

6. **Water Droppers (水滴)**: Small vessels used to add drops of water to ink stones. These are among the smallest and most delicate Ru Ware pieces.

**Paragraph 3: Structural Features**

Despite their variety, most Ru Ware vessels share certain structural features:

**The Mouth/Rim (口沿)**: The top opening of the vessel. In Ru Ware, rims are usually simple and undecorated. They may be straight, slightly flared, or gently curved inward. The rim is often slightly thickened for strength and comfortable handling.

**The Body/Wall (器身/器壁)**: The main part of the vessel. Ru Ware bodies typically have smooth, flowing curves without sharp angles. The walls are relatively thin, showing the craftsman's skill, but thick enough for strength. The thickness is usually even throughout, demonstrating precise control.

**The Foot Ring (圈足)**: The circular base on which the vessel stands. Most Ru Ware has an unglazed foot ring, revealing the clay body beneath. The foot ring is carefully shaped and proportioned to balance the vessel. Its size and height affect both the stability and the visual elegance of the piece.

**The Interior (内部)**: The inside surface is as carefully finished as the exterior. The glaze covers the interior completely, creating a smooth, practical surface. The interior curves flow naturally from the rim to the base.

**Paragraph 4: Proportions and Harmony**

Ancient Chinese craftsmen followed principles of proportion and harmony. The relationship between different parts creates visual balance:

- **Height to width ratio**: Most Ru Ware follows pleasing proportions, often approaching the golden ratio (1:1.618)
- **Wall thickness**: Thin enough to appear delicate, thick enough for practical use
- **Foot ring proportion**: Usually between 1/3 to 1/2 the diameter of the mouth
- **Curve quality**: Smooth transitions without abrupt changes

These mathematical relationships were not calculated but felt by experienced craftsmen. They understood intuitively what looked "right." This instinctive sense of proportion came from years of practice and observation of natural forms.

**Paragraph 5: Decorative Elements (or Lack Thereof)**

The most striking feature of Ru Ware decoration is its absence. Unlike many other porcelains that feature:

- Painted designs
- Carved patterns
- Applied decorations
- Colorful glazes

Ru Ware is almost entirely plain. The "decoration" consists of:

1. **The glaze itself**: The beautiful sky-blue color and jade-like texture serve as the primary decorative element.

2. **Crackle patterns**: Natural cracks in the glaze create subtle, ever-changing patterns. These are not applied decorations but natural results of the firing process.

3. **Form and proportion**: The shape itself is the decoration. Every curve, every proportion is carefully considered.

4. **Occasional marks**: Some pieces have small sesame-seed-like marks (芝麻钉) on the base where the piece rested on supports during firing. These tiny marks are now valued as authentication features.

This minimalist approach reflects the Song Dynasty belief that true beauty needs no embellishment. The Chinese aesthetic concept "tianran qu diao" (天然去雕) means "natural beauty without carving" - the highest form of artistic achievement.

**Paragraph 6: Function and Daily Use**

Each Ru Ware form served specific functions in Song Dynasty life:

**Plates and Bowls**: Used in imperial dining. The smooth glaze and perfect curves enhanced the dining experience. The sky-blue color was believed to reveal poison (a common concern in court life).

**Washers**: Essential tools for scholars and calligraphers. The wide, shallow form allowed easy brush washing. The smooth interior prevented damage to brush bristles.

**Vases**: Displayed flowers in scholarly studies and reception halls. Simple forms didn't distract from the natural beauty of flowers. The narrow neck supported flower stems elegantly.

**Water Droppers**: Precision tools for adding water to ink stones. The small size allowed precise control. Often shaped like fruits or animals for aesthetic pleasure.

**Incense Burners**: Used in meditation, ceremonies, and daily life. The tripod form allowed air circulation beneath. Heat could disperse without damaging furniture.

**Paragraph 7: Modern Appreciation**

Today, collectors and museums value Ru Ware not just for its rarity but for its perfect embodiment of Song Dynasty aesthetics. When describing Ru Ware forms, experts use terms like:

- **Elegant (优雅)**: Graceful lines and refined proportions
- **Restrained (克制)**: Beauty without excess
- **Harmonious (和谐)**: Perfect balance of all elements
- **Timeless (永恒)**: Forms that remain beautiful across centuries
- **Sophisticated (精致)**: Simple appearance, complex achievement

Modern designers still study Ru Ware for inspiration. The clean lines and perfect proportions influence contemporary ceramics, furniture, and even industrial design. The lesson of Ru Ware remains relevant: true elegance comes from perfection of form, not multiplication of decoration.

## Part 6: Cultural Insight

### The Philosophy of Form

**The Song Dynasty Aesthetic Revolution**

The Song Dynasty (960-1279) marked a revolution in Chinese aesthetics. Unlike the vibrant Tang Dynasty that preceded it, Song culture valued:

- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Subtlety over boldness**
- **Natural beauty over artificial decoration**
- **Inner refinement over external display**

This shift reflected Confucian and Buddhist philosophical influences. The scholar-official class, who were both government administrators and artists, developed a sophisticated taste for understated elegance.

**"Tianran Qu Diao" (天然去雕饰) - Natural Beauty Without Carving**

This phrase from a Tang Dynasty poem became a Song aesthetic ideal. It means:

- True beauty doesn't need embellishment
- The highest art appears artless
- Simplicity is more difficult than complexity
- Removing unnecessary elements is harder than adding them

Ru Ware perfectly embodies this philosophy. Each vessel achieves beauty through:

- Perfect proportions (not decoration)
- Exquisite glazes (not painted designs)
- Flawless craftsmanship (not surface ornament)

**Form Follows Function**

Long before the modern design principle "form follows function," Song Dynasty craftsmen understood this concept. Every aspect of a Ru Ware vessel serves a purpose:

**Bowls:**

- Curved walls fit comfortably in hands
- Round shape distributes weight evenly
- Smooth interior is easy to clean
- Proportions create visual balance

**Washers:**

- Wide, shallow form allows easy brush washing
- Gentle curves prevent water splashing
- Smooth glaze protects brush bristles
- Stable base prevents tipping

**Vases:**

- Narrow neck supports flower stems
- Wide belly provides water volume
- Simple form doesn't compete with flowers
- Weight distribution ensures stability

**The Golden Ratio in Chinese Aesthetics**

While ancient Chinese craftsmen didn't use mathematical formulas, many Ru Ware pieces approach the golden ratio (approximately 1:1.618). This proportion appears throughout nature and art, creating inherently pleasing visual relationships.

Chinese craftsmen called this feeling "shun yan" (顺眼) - "pleasing to the eye." They achieved it through:

- Years of training and practice
- Observation of natural forms
- Intuitive understanding of balance
- Respect for tradition combined with personal sensitivity

**Comparison with Other Ceramic Traditions**

**Chinese (Song Dynasty) vs. European (Rococo) Ceramics:**

- Song: Minimalist, monochrome, form-focused
- Rococo: Ornate, colorful, decoration-focused

**Chinese (Ru Ware) vs. Japanese (Tea Ceremony) Ceramics:**

- Both value simplicity and natural beauty
- Ru: Perfect proportions, refined elegance
- Japanese: Deliberately imperfect, rustic charm (wabi-sabi)

**Modern Relevance**

The aesthetic principles of Ru Ware remain influential today:

**Apple products:** Minimalist design, focus on form and function **Scandinavian design:** Clean lines, natural materials, simplicity **Japanese Muji brand:** "No-brand" aesthetic, essential forms **Modernist architecture:** "Less is more" philosophy

These modern movements echo Song Dynasty values:

- Quality over quantity
- Essence over decoration
- Function informing beauty
- Respect for materials and craftsmanship

**Discussion Questions:**

1. Why do you think simple forms are often more difficult to design than complex ones?
2. How does the "form follows function" principle apply to modern technology?
3. Do you prefer minimalist or decorated aesthetic? Why?
4. Can you think of other objects that achieve "beauty without carving"?
5. How might the Song Dynasty aesthetic influence future design?

## Teacher's Notes

**Teaching Tips:**

1. **Visual Materials Essential**: This unit requires extensive visual materials. Collect high-quality images of Ru Ware from different angles. If possible, bring replica vessels or other ceramics to class for hands-on examination.

2. **Measurement Practice**: Bring actual vessels (can be any ceramic) for students to measure and describe. This makes abstract concepts concrete.

3. **Drawing Activities**: Even simple sketching helps students understand form. Provide templates if students are uncomfortable with free drawing.

4. **Form and Function Discussion**: Connect to students' daily experiences. Discuss modern product design (phones, furniture, etc.) using the same vocabulary.

5. **Museum Connection**: If possible, arrange a museum visit or virtual tour. Seeing real Ru Ware helps students appreciate what they're learning.

**Common Student Errors:**

- Confusing "height" and "high" (The height is 20 cm. / It is 20 cm high.)
- Using wrong prepositions (common: "in the top" instead of "at the top")
- Mixing up "wide" and "width" in sentences
- Literal translation of Chinese terms (e.g., "circle foot" instead of "foot ring")
- Describing everything as "beautiful" without specific vocabulary
- Forgetting to use measurement units (saying "20" instead of "20 cm")

**Extension Activities:**

- **Math Connection**: Calculate volume, surface area, ratios
- **Art Connection**: Students create their own vessel designs on paper or with clay
- **History Connection**: Research how vessel forms evolved across different Chinese dynasties
- **Science Connection**: Discuss center of gravity, structural stability
- **Comparative Culture**: Compare Chinese, Japanese, and European ceramic forms

**Assessment Options:**

- **Informal**:
  
  - Oral descriptions of vessels in class
  - Participation in speaking activities
  - Accuracy in using prepositions and measurements

- **Formal**:
  
  - Written vessel description (150-200 words)
  - Vocabulary and grammar quiz
  - Design portfolio project
  - Oral presentation of vessel design

- **Portfolio**:
  
  - Collect all drawings and descriptions
  - Design portfolio with technical drawings
  - Reflection journal entries
  - AI-generated visuals and analysis

**Differentiation Strategies:**

- **For Advanced Students**:
  
  - Research the mathematics of proportion (golden ratio, Fibonacci sequence)
  - Compare Ru Ware with other minimalist art movements
  - Create more complex vessel designs with multiple views
  - Write comparative essays on aesthetic philosophies

- **For Struggling Students**:
  
  - Provide vessel templates for tracing
  - Give word banks for descriptions
  - Simplify project (describe existing vessel instead of designing new one)
  - Allow more use of diagrams instead of written descriptions
  - Pair with stronger students for peer support

- **For Visual Learners**:
  
  - Emphasize drawing and visual analysis
  - Use color-coding for different parts
  - Create visual vocabulary charts
  - Watch videos of pottery being made and used

- **For Kinesthetic Learners**:
  
  - Handle actual ceramic vessels
  - Create clay models
  - Act out the use of different vessel types
  - Use hand gestures to describe shapes and proportions

**Time Management:**

- **Day 1** (2 hours): Warm-up, Reading (Paragraphs 1-3), Vessel types vocabulary
- **Day 2** (2 hours): Reading (Paragraphs 4-5), Vessel parts vocabulary, Preposition focus
- **Day 3** (1.5 hours): Reading (Paragraphs 6-7), Measurement expressions, Practice exercises

- **Day 5** (1.5 hours): Writing practice, AI activities, Project introduction
- **Day 6-7** (3 hours): Project work time, peer review, presentations

**Integration with Previous Units:**

- **Unit 1**: Review basic Ru Ware features when discussing forms
- **Unit 2**: Connect glaze qualities to how they interact with different forms
- **Unit 3**: Remind students how different forms require different production techniques
- **Looking ahead to Unit 5**: Forms affect how vessels are designed and innovated

**Additional Resources for Teachers:**

- "Teaching Design: A Guide for Educators" - pedagogical approaches
- "Visual Literacy in the Classroom" - using images effectively
- Chinese aesthetic philosophy texts (translated excerpts)
- Museum education department resources

**Cultural Sensitivity Notes:**

- Emphasize that aesthetic preferences are culturally influenced
- Avoid saying one aesthetic is "better" than another
- Encourage students to appreciate different traditions
- Connect Song Dynasty values to universal design principles
- Respect students who prefer more decorated styles

**Technology Integration:**

- Use interactive whiteboards to annotate vessel images
- Digital portfolios can be created in Google Slides or similar
