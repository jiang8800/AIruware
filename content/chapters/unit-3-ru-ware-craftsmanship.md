## Part 2: Ru Ware Background

### Reading: The Ancient Art of Making Ru Ware

**Paragraph 1: The Master Craftsmen**

Making Ru Ware requires extraordinary skill and patience. During the Song Dynasty, only the most talented craftsmen were selected to work in the imperial Ru kiln. These artisans dedicated their entire lives to perfecting their craft. They learned techniques from their masters and passed the knowledge to their apprentices. This tradition of master-apprentice teaching ensured that the secrets of Ru Ware production were carefully preserved. Today, modern craftsmen still study ancient techniques and try to recreate the beauty of original Ru Ware.

**Paragraph 2: The Complete Production Process**

The making of Ru Ware involves six main stages: clay selection, forming, trimming, drying, glazing, and firing. Each stage requires precise control and years of experience. A small mistake at any stage can ruin the entire piece. The whole process, from raw clay to finished product, can take several weeks or even months. This slow, careful approach reflects the Song Dynasty philosophy of "slow work produces fine results" (慢工出细活).

**Paragraph 3: Stage 1 - Clay Selection (选料)**

The first step is choosing the right clay. Not all clay can be used for Ru Ware. Craftsmen select fine, pure clay from specific locations near Ruzhou. The clay must have the right mineral composition and plasticity. After digging, the clay is cleaned to remove stones and impurities. Then it is mixed with water and aged for several months. This aging process makes the clay smoother and easier to work with. The Chinese call this "nourishing the clay" (养泥).

**Paragraph 4: Stage 2 - Forming (拉坯/成型)**

After the clay is ready, craftsmen shape it into vessels. There are two main forming methods:

1. **Wheel throwing**: The craftsman places a lump of clay on a spinning potter's wheel. As the wheel rotates, they use their hands to pull and shape the clay upward. This technique requires great skill - the walls must be even and the shape must be symmetrical. One wrong move can collapse the entire form.

2. **Hand building**: For more complex shapes, craftsmen build pieces by hand using coils or slabs of clay. This method allows more creative freedom but takes longer.

Most traditional Ru Ware was made using the wheel-throwing technique. The pieces were typically small and elegant, perfect for imperial use.

**Paragraph 5: Stage 3 - Trimming (修坯)**

Once the basic shape is formed, the piece must dry until it is "leather-hard" - firm but not completely dry. At this stage, craftsmen use sharp tools to trim excess clay and refine the shape. They carefully carve the foot ring (圈足) at the bottom. They smooth the surface and perfect the curves. This trimming stage determines the final elegance of the piece. Ancient craftsmen said: "Three parts depend on forming, seven parts depend on trimming" (三分拉坯，七分修坯). This shows how important this stage is.

**Paragraph 6: Stage 4 - Drying (干燥)**

After trimming, the piece must dry completely before glazing. This process cannot be rushed. If the clay dries too quickly, it will crack. If it stays wet too long, mold may grow. Craftsmen place the pieces in a controlled environment with proper ventilation and humidity. The drying time depends on the size and thickness of the piece, usually taking several days to two weeks. Patience is essential at this stage.

**Paragraph 7: Stage 5 - Glazing (施釉)**

Glazing is one of the most critical stages. The famous sky-blue color of Ru Ware comes from a special glaze formula containing agate powder. Craftsmen mix the glaze ingredients carefully according to secret recipes passed down through generations. The glaze is applied to the dried clay body using different techniques:

- **Dipping**: The piece is dipped into liquid glaze
- **Pouring**: Glaze is poured over the surface
- **Brushing**: Glaze is painted on with a brush
- **Spraying**: Glaze is sprayed evenly (modern method)

The glaze must be applied evenly. If too thick, it will run during firing. If too thin, the color will be weak. Most Ru Ware pieces were dipped in glaze, leaving only the foot ring unglazed. This technique is called "full glaze" (满釉).

**Paragraph 8: Stage 6 - Firing (烧制)**

The final and most dramatic stage is firing in the kiln. This process transforms ordinary clay into magnificent ceramic. Ru Ware is fired at approximately 1,250-1,280 degrees Celsius. The firing process has several phases:

1. **Loading**: Pieces are carefully arranged in the kiln, separated by supports
2. **Heating**: Temperature gradually increases over 12-24 hours
3. **High-temperature hold**: Temperature is maintained at the peak for several hours
4. **Cooling**: The kiln cools down slowly over 24-48 hours

During firing, the glaze melts and fuses with the clay body. The minerals in the glaze create the beautiful sky-blue color. As the kiln cools, the famous crackle patterns form naturally due to different contraction rates between glaze and clay. The craftsman cannot open the kiln until it has completely cooled. Opening the kiln is always an exciting and nervous moment - many pieces may have failed during firing.

**Paragraph 9: Success Rate and the Artisan Spirit**

Even with perfect technique, the success rate for Ru Ware is low. In ancient times, only 10-20% of pieces survived firing without defects. Many factors can cause failure: temperature fluctuations, glaze running, warping, or incomplete melting. Each failed piece represents hours of careful work lost. However, true craftsmen never give up. They view failures as teachers and continuously improve their skills. This persistence and dedication embodies the Chinese artisan spirit (工匠精神) - the pursuit of perfection through patience, practice, and respect for tradition.

### Grammar Focus: Passive Voice for Processes

When describing manufacturing processes, we often use passive voice to focus on the action rather than the person doing it.

**Structure:** Subject + be + past participle (+ by + agent)

**Active vs. Passive:**

- Active: Craftsmen select fine clay.
- Passive: Fine clay is selected (by craftsmen).

**Why use passive voice?**

- The process is more important than who does it
- The agent (person doing the action) is unknown or obvious
- More formal and objective tone

**Common Passive Structures in Process Description:**

| Tense           | Structure                       | Example                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Present Simple  | is/are + past participle        | The clay is cleaned and aged.     |
| Past Simple     | was/were + past participle      | Ru Ware was made in Ruzhou.       |
| Present Perfect | has/have been + past participle | The technique has been preserved. |
| Modal           | can/must be + past participle   | The glaze must be applied evenly. |

**Practice Sentences:**

1. The clay ________ (select) carefully.
2. Impurities ________ (remove) from the clay.
3. The piece ________ (place) on the potter's wheel.
4. The glaze ________ (apply) in three layers.
5. The kiln ________ (heat) to 1,280 degrees.
6. Crackle patterns ________ (form) during cooling.

### Sequence Words and Phrases

To describe processes step by step, we use sequence words:

**Beginning:**

- First, / First of all, / To begin with,
- The first step is...
- Initially,

**Middle:**

- Then, / Next, / After that,
- Second, / Third, / Fourth,
- Following this,
- Subsequently,
- Once... / After... / When...

**End:**

- Finally, / Lastly,
- The final step is...
- At last,
- Eventually,

**Examples:**

- "First, craftsmen select fine clay. Then, they clean it to remove impurities. Next, the clay is mixed with water. After that, it is aged for several months. Finally, it is ready for forming."

### Reading Practice

**Task 1: Read and Answer**

Read this passage about the trimming stage:

"Trimming is considered by many craftsmen to be the most important stage in Ru Ware production. The ancient saying goes: 'Three parts depend on forming, seven parts depend on trimming.' This means that 70% of the piece's final quality comes from careful trimming work. During trimming, the craftsman removes excess clay, refines the curves, carves the foot ring, and smooths the surface. Each movement must be precise. Too much pressure will damage the piece. Too little will leave the surface rough. Master craftsmen can feel the exact thickness of the clay wall through their fingertips. This sensitivity comes only from years of practice."

**Questions:**

1. Why is trimming so important?
2. What does the ancient saying mean?
3. What happens during the trimming stage?
4. How do master craftsmen know the clay thickness?
5. What does "sensitivity" require?

**Task 2: Process Sequencing**

**Practice:** Have natural conversations explaining Ru Ware craftsmanship.

---

## Part 6: Cultural Insight

### The Artisan Spirit (工匠精神)

**What is the Artisan Spirit?**

The Chinese artisan spirit represents a philosophy of work and life:

1. **Dedication**: Devoting one's entire life to mastering a craft
2. **Precision**: Pursuing perfection in every detail
3. **Patience**: Understanding that great work takes time
4. **Humility**: Continuous learning and respect for tradition
5. **Persistence**: Never giving up despite failures
6. **Innovation**: Improving techniques while respecting tradition

**The Master-Apprentice System (师徒制度)**

Traditional Chinese crafts are passed down through a master-apprentice relationship:

- **Master (师傅)**: Experienced craftsman with deep knowledge
- **Apprentice (徒弟)**: Student who learns through observation and practice
- **Learning period**: Often 3-5 years of intensive training
- **Teaching method**: "Teach by example, learn by doing" (言传身教)

This system ensures that skills and secrets are preserved across generations. The relationship between master and apprentice is like family - built on trust, respect, and loyalty.

**Slow Work Produces Fine Results (慢工出细活)**

This Chinese proverb captures an important philosophy:

- Quality matters more than speed
- Rushing leads to mistakes
- True mastery requires time and patience
- The best results come from careful, deliberate work

In modern fast-paced society, this ancient wisdom reminds us to value quality and craftsmanship over mass production.

**Intangible Cultural Heritage (非物质文化遗产)**

Ru Ware production techniques are recognized as intangible cultural heritage. This means:

- The knowledge and skills are as valuable as the objects produced
- Traditional techniques must be protected and passed on
- Living masters are "bearers" of cultural heritage
- Modern society has a responsibility to support traditional crafts

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How is the artisan spirit relevant in the AI age?
2. What modern jobs or skills require similar dedication and patience?
3. Compare the master-apprentice system with modern education. What are the advantages of each?
4. Why is it important to preserve traditional craftsmanship?
5. Would you like to become an apprentice to learn a traditional craft? Why or why not?

## Teacher's Notes

**Teaching Tips:**

1. **Demonstration**: If possible, bring clay to class or show live pottery videos. Students understand better when they can see the process.

2. **Hands-on Activity**: Arrange a field trip to a local pottery studio or invite a ceramicist to demonstrate. Even working with playdough helps students understand forming and trimming.

3. **Process Focus**: Emphasize that understanding the process helps students appreciate the final product more deeply.

4. **Grammar Integration**: Use process descriptions from other subjects (chemistry experiments, cooking, etc.) to practice passive voice before focusing on Ru Ware.

5. **Cultural Connection**: Discuss how the artisan spirit applies to students' own studies and future careers.

**Common Student Errors:**

- Mixing active an

5. **Cultural Connection**: Discuss how the artisan spirit applies to students' own studies and future careers.

**Common Student Errors:**

- Mixing active and passive voice inconsistently
- Forgetting "be" verb in passive constructions (e.g., "The clay cleaned" instead of "The clay is cleaned")
- Overusing sequence words (using them in every sentence)
- Confusing "firing" (烧制) with "fire" (火)
- Literal translation of Chinese process terms
- Using present continuous for habitual processes (should use simple present)

**Extension Activities:**

- **Science Connection**: Explain the chemistry of clay hardening and glaze formation
- **Math Connection**: Calculate firing time, temperature changes, success rates
- **History Connection**: Research how ceramic technology spread along the Silk Road
- **Art Connection**: Students try simple hand-building with clay or playdough
- **Business Connection**: Calculate production costs and pricing

**Assessment Options:**

- **Informal Assessment**:
  - Participation in discussions
  - Correct use of vocabulary in speaking activities
  - Process sequencing exercises
- **Formal Assessment**:
  - Written process description (100-150 words)
  - Passive voice grammar quiz
  - Documentary script project
  - Oral presentation on one production stage
- **Portfolio Assessment**:
  - Collect all written work
  - Student's self-reflection journal
  - AI-generated visual materials
  - Recorded video presentation (if completed)

**Differentiation Strategies:**

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Research the chemistry of glazes and write a scientific explanation
  - Compare Ru Ware techniques with other ceramic traditions (Japanese, Korean)
  - Analyze how technology has changed traditional crafts
  - Interview a local craftsperson (if available)
- **For Struggling Students**:
  - Provide process diagrams with labels
  - Give sentence frames for passive voice practice
  - Simplify the documentary project (poster instead of video script)
  - Allow more Chinese-English code-switching in early practice
  - Partner with stronger students for peer support
- **For Visual Learners**:
  - Use more videos and images
  - Create process flowcharts
  - Draw their own process diagrams
  - Use color-coding for different stages
- **For Kinesthetic Learners**:
  - Arrange hands-on clay activities
  - Act out the production process
  - Visit workshops or studios
  - Use gesture to remember vocabulary

**Cross-Cultural Connections:**

Compare Ru Ware craftsmanship with other cultural traditions:

- Japanese tea ceremony ceramics
- European porcelain (Meissen, Sèvres)
- Native American pottery
- Islamic ceramic traditions

Discuss: What values and philosophies are reflected in different ceramic traditions?
